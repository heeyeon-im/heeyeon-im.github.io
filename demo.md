**1. Visuomotor learning: dual-task paradigms** (Click the image to see animation.)<br/>
[![Demo flash](../images/Flash_logo.jpg)](../Flash.gif)<br />
* Reaching and rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks<br/>
  * Encoding attentional states during visuomotor adaptation (Im et al., _J of Vision_, 2015)<br/>
  * Long lasting attentional-context dependent visuomotor memory (Im et al., _J of Experimenal Psychology: HPP_, 2016)<br/>
[![Demo flash](../images/Flash_logo11.jpg)](../Flash.gif)<br />  
* Reaching and visual conjunction search tasks<br/>
  * Paradoxical benefits of attentional distraction for visuomotor adaptation without awareness (Im & Song, _Under Review_)<br/>

**2. Crowd emotion task** (Click the image to see animation.)<br/> 
[![Demo flash](../images/Flash_logo2.jpg)](../Flash2.gif)<br />
  * Ensemble coding of crowd emotion: Differential hemispheric and visual stream contributions (Im et al., _Nature Human Behav._, 2017)<br/>
  * Cross-cultural effects on ensemble coding of emotion in facial crowds (Im et al., _Culture and Brain_, 2017)<br/>

**3a. Creating Magnocellular biased images** (Click the image to see animation.)<br/>
[![Demo flash](../images/Flash_logo3.jpg)](../Flash3.gif)<br />
     
**3b. Creating Parvocellular biased images** (Click the image to see animation.)<br/>
[![Demo flash](../images/Flash_logo4.jpg)](../Flash4.gif)<br />
* Sex-related differences in behavioral and amygdalar responses to compound facial threat cues (Im et al., _Human Brain Mapping_, 2018)<br/>
* Observerâ€™s anxiety facilitates magnocellular processing of clear facial threat cues, but impairs parvocellular processing of ambiguous facial threat cues. (Im et al., _Scientific Reports_, 2017)

**4. Average size task** (Click the image to see animation.)<br/> 
[![Demo flash](../images/Flash_logo5.jpg)](../Flash5.gif)<br />
* Ensemble statistics as a unit of selection (Im et al., _J Cognitive Psychology._, 2015)<br/>
* Mean size as a unit of visual working memory (Im & Chong, _Perception_, 2014)
[![Demo flash](../images/Flash_logo6.jpg)](../Flash6.gif)<br /> 
* The effects of sampling and internal noise on the representation of ensemble average size (Im & Halberda, _Attention, Perception & Psychophysics_, 2013)
[![Demo flash](../images/Flash_logo7.jpg)](../Flash7.gif)<br /> 
* Computation of mean size is based on perceived size (Im & Chong, _Attention, Perception & Psychophysics_, 2009)

**5. Approximate number estimation task** (Click the image to see animation.)<br/> 
[![Demo flash](../images/Flash_logo8.jpg)](../Flash8.gif)<br />
* Perceptual groups as a unit for rapid extraction of approximate number of elements in random dot arrays (Im et al., _Vision Research_, 2016)

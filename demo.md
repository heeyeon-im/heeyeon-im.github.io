* Sex-related differences in behavioral and amygdalar responses to compound facial threat cues (Im et al., _Human Brain Mapping_, 2018)<br/>
* Observerâ€™s anxiety facilitates magnocellular processing of clear facial threat cues, but impairs parvocellular processing of ambiguous facial threat cues. (Im et al., _Scientific Reports_, 2017)

My research projects aim to identify how brain dynamics guide goal-directed, adaptive behaviors in human. Human behaviors are made up of cross-talks across different modalities of perceptual, cognitive and action control processes. Since such cross-talks are manifested in many different processing channels and brain pathways that emerge in parallel, the findings of my research immediately provide clear insights into complex brain-behavior relationships across time and context, leading to translational studies to improve the way we interact with, respond to, and control the external world.<br/>

Specific contributions of my research projects to the field highlight interactions between object-based and ensemble-based representations, between selective and non-selective pathways, and between perceptual and action control processes. My research suggests that goal-driven behaviors are effectively supported by multiple streams of these parallel processes. This stands in contrast to traditional theories of serial, non-overlapping processing stages across perception, cognition, and action. Instead of simplifying that action is the aftermath of cognition or perception, a new model needs to include effects of continuous interactions across perception, cognition, and action control processes, which can be observed by measuring dynamic connections between brain and behavior. 

## **1. Perceptual flexibility empowers cognitive capabilities and action outcomes.**
The visual system reorganizes complex visual scenes using strategies for forming coherent and concise representations, rather than passively receiving all (millions of) bits of visual information hitting our retinas at any given moment. One powerful heuristic for this is to represent sets of similar objects as a group or **_ensemble_** using summary statistics such as mean, numerosity, and variance, etc.

Ensemble perception makes great intuitive sense. If we look around, we always find some redundancy and regularity in the real world images: Blueberries in a bush, trees in a forest, and buildings in a city, for example, are often seen as groups of similar but not identical objects. For most everyday needs, we may not need to store individuating information from these scenes. We can instead represent structures, patterns, and gists in a succinct and compact manner. Such perceptual ability to extract ensemble representations from complex scenes can allow our brain to "do more with less" and better understand and interact with visual environments. One line of my research program investigates how our brain achieves this feat and how ensemble perception empowers our perceptual, cognitive, and action control abilities in many different ways.

__* Ensemble perception as a strategy for coping with limitations on cognitive abilities__

Representing and storing an ensemble (e.g., average) of multiple objects can help the visual system to maintain and recall individual features of the elements. At the object level, only a few items may be remembered; the rest may be missed completely due to the limited memory capacity. When attempting to recall missed objects, one would have to make random guesses, increasing the overall expected error. However, average information about the set can guide one to recall the missed object to some extent by retrieving values biased toward the average of the set.
Say you try to remember the different colors of six disks in a visual array and report the colors you remember. If you remember only the colors of three disks and completely missed the others, you cannot avoid making extreme errors for the three forgotten colors (e.g., by randomly choosing "red" for a blue disk). However, if you remember that the disks were in ‘cool’ colors on average (even if you cannot remember the exact colors for each disk), it is likely that you will reduce the overall error by choosing six colors from only the continuum of ‘cool’ colors and avoid ‘warm’ colors such as red or orange.

I have shown that a visual image in which individual items are spatially grouped together allows the visual system to extract, select, and remember more ensembles from the image, compared to that of individuals that are spatially intermixed (Im & Chong, 2014; Im, Park, & Chong, 2015). This suggests that reconstructing individuals in a visual scene in a coherent manner (e.g., sets or ensembles) is an efficient strategy to increase our memory capacity. This is somewhat similar to using a "chunking" or "binding" approach for verbal memory to reducing the amount of information we have to deal with at once (e.g., recoding the separate letters F-B-I-C-I-A-N-S-A into three words, FBI, CIA, and NSA). Likewise, ensemble perception allows us to compress information of individuals in a visual image into a compact and meaningful "chunks", saving cognitive resources that can be used to process and remember more information about the scene.

__* Hierarchical coding for representational flexiblity: Objects and Ensembles__<br/>
This finding illustrates an example of how a visual scene can be represented hierarchically. The findings that the ease of parsing sets from an image facilitated attentional selection and memory capacity of ensemble representations of objects have led me to suggest that hierarchical coding of objects and ensembles allows the visual system to acheive perceptual flexibility.

In one of my study (Im, Zhong, & Halberda, 2016, see Demo here), I employed a computer vision algorithm to characterize and predict human observers' patterns of grouping multiple dots into sets based on spatial proximity. I found that human observers' grouping pattern was surprisingly similar, even though we asked them to group the dots in whatever way they felt the most comfortable and natural.
Moreover, I also found that the way human observers grouped the dots into sets (predicted by the model uisng my clustering algorithm) systematically modulated the way they estimated the number of individual dots.

Although Images A and B both have 29 dots, the estimated number of individual dots by human observers were dramatically different, with Image A (less clustered) being perceived as having more dots than Image B (more clustered). My clustering algorithm could accurately predict the degree to which human observers underestimated the number of individual dots in the more clustered image (e.g., Image B). The findings of this study provides an example of how representations of "sets" and "individual objects" are extracted from the same image to interact with each other: The way dots are grouped and clustered modulates visual impression of number of the individuals, just as the way individuals are positioned modulates the way they are grouped.

## **2. Action goals guide perception.**
Interactions between perception and action are bidirectional. I have found the behavioral and neural evidence suggesting that different social motivations and action goals (e.g., approach and avoidance) shape the way we perceive emotional states and behavioral intent of crowds of people. For example, when the observers’ goal was to avoid a potential threat in a social environment, they recognized a crowd of angry faces much more accurately and rapidly than a crowd of happy faces5. This finding suggests that our goals for ongoing interactions with the external world influences the way we perceive the world, just as what we see guides our ongoing interactions with the world. Furthermore, my fMRI and MEG data showed that there are (at least) two different processing routes for this: a fast processing route along the dorsal pathway in the brain for global perception of, and fast reaction to, social crowds and a slower processing route along the ventral pathway for local and detailed perception of individual faces5,14. The next step is to further understand the properties and functions of these two processing routes and to examine how these pathways interact with and work in parallel with other routes to support goal-directed actions (_This work in this area received an ECOR Tosteson Postdoctoral Fellowship Award for Medical Discovery and was funded by Massachusetts General Hospital_).

## **3. Attentional distraction can facilitate perception and action.**
Although it is generally accepted, and usually valid, that distracted attention impairs perceptual and behavioral performance, I have found advantages of distributed (or distracted) attention over focused attention in some perceptual tasks and motor learning. For example, distributed attention facilitates global processing of a visual image7,10 and enhances memory retrieval of visually-guided actions that have been learned under similar distraction11-13. These results suggest that as another processing route, distributed attention can enhance our perception and action under some circumstances in which focused attention may actually hinder performance. A broader attentional focus afforded by reduced control under distributed attention can allow us to learn more about the background and context of the environment, compared to the mode of focused attention. This line of research has led me to pursue one of my future research aims of characterizing how these non-selective and selective routes guide each other to support different aspects for our complex behaviors, with the goal of understanding how cognition modulates perception and action in our complex behaviors across a range of tasks. New findings from this research will contribute to better rehabilitation/training programs for patients with motor degenerative diseases and those who need to refine and adjust their perception-action coordination after injuries or surgeries (_This work in this area was recognized and supported by a Center for Vision Research Award at Brown University_).

My primary research interest is to identify and understand fundamental mechanisms of human brain dynamics, which involves cross-talks across different modalities of perceptual, cognitive and action control processes. Since the brain dynamics is manifested in many processing channels and pathways that emerge in parallel during adaptive, goal-driven behaviors, the findings of my research immediately provide clear insights into complex brain-behavior relationships, leading to translational studies to improve the way we interact with, respond to, and control the external world.

## **1. Perceptual flexibility empowers cognitive capabilities and action outcomes.**
------
The visual system can achieve flexibility by extracting two different units of perception – objects and ensembles. This perceptual ability allows the brain to “do more with less”, by using powerful and efficient heuristics that bypass its perceptual and cognitive limitations.

I have shown that representations of objects and ensembles can be extracted to be available at the same time, such that they provide complementary information about the scene to be combined into a unified perception. By combining these different levels of representation, the visual system can perceive, and we can remember, the visual scene with greater detail, which can then effectively guide better action outcomes. For example, a visual impression of how objects are spatially clustered in the whole image modulates the way we see, remember, and act on each individual object in the scene.

Thus, these findings provide an insight to richness of our perceptual experiences, resulting from hierarchical coding of different levels and modalities of visual representations. Characterizing how such hierarchical representations fill in the gaps in our perception will also have broad applicability to science and engineering that is impacted by the interface between sighted humans and machines of all types.<br />

## **2. Action goals guide perception.**
------
Interactions between perception and action are bidirectional. I have found the behavioral and neural evidence suggesting that different social motivations and action goals (e.g., approach and avoidance) shape the way we perceive emotional states and behavioral intent of crowds of people.

For example, when the observers’ goal was to avoid a potential threat in a social environment, they recognized a crowd of angry faces much more accurately and rapidly than a crowd of happy faces5. This finding suggests that our goals for ongoing interactions with the external world influences the way we perceive the world, just as what we see guides our ongoing interactions with the world. Furthermore, my fMRI and MEG data showed that there are (at least) two different processing routes for this: a fast processing route along the dorsal pathway in the brain for global perception of, and fast reaction to, social crowds and a slower processing route along the ventral pathway for local and detailed perception of individual faces.

## **3. Attentional distraction can facilitate perception and action.** 
------
Although it is generally accepted, and usually valid, that distracted attention impairs perceptual and behavioral performance, I have found advantages of distributed (or distracted) attention over focused attention in some perceptual tasks and motor learning.

For example, distributed attention facilitates global processing of a visual image and enhances memory retrieval of visually-guided actions that have been learned under similar distraction. These results suggest that as another processing route, distributed attention can enhance our perception and action under some circumstances in which focused attention may actually hinder performance. A broader attentional focus afforded by reduced control under distributed attention can allow us to learn more about the background and context of the environment, compared to the mode of focused attention.

This line of research has led me to pursue one of my future research aims of characterizing how these non-selective and selective routes guide each other to support different aspects for our complex behaviors, with the goal of understanding how cognition modulates perception and action in our complex behaviors across a range of tasks.

New findings from this research will contribute to better rehabilitation/training programs for patients with motor degenerative diseases and those who need to refine and adjust their perception-action coordination after injuries or surgeries. _This work in this area was recognized and supported by a Center for Vision Research Award at Brown University._

My research projects aim to identify and understand how brain dynamics guide adaptive behaviors in human. Human behaviors are made up of cross-talks across different modalities of perceptual, cognitive and action control processes. Since such cross-talks are manifested in many different processing channels and pathways that emerge in parallel, the findings of my research immediately provide clear insights into complex brain-behavior relationships across time and context, leading to translational studies to improve the way we interact with, respond to, and control the external world.<br/>

## **1. Perceptual flexibility empowers cognitive capabilities and action outcomes.**
The visual system reorganizes complex visual scenes using efficient strategies for forming coherent and concise representations, rather than passively receiving all (millions of) bits of visual information hitting our retinas at any given moment. One powerful heuristic for this is to represent sets of similar objects as a group or **_ensemble_** using summary statistics such as mean, numerosity, and variance, etc.

Ensemble perception makes great intuitive sense. If we look around, we always find some redundancy and regularity in the real world images and scenes: Trees in a forest, blueberries in a bush, and buildings in a city, for example, are often seen as groups of similar but not identical objects. For most everyday needs, we may not need to store individuating information from these scenes. We can instead represent structures, patterns, and gists in a succinct and compact manner. 
My research has shown that such perceptual ability to represent ensemble statistics from complex visual scenes can allow the brain to "do more with less" and better understand and interact with visual environments. Ensemble perception is a crucial mechanism for coping with the limitations on visual processing, enhancing our cognitive abilities (e.g., remembering or making decisions) and action outcomes in many ways.

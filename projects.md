My research projects aim to identify and understand how brain dynamics guide adaptive behaviors in human. Human behaviors are made up of cross-talks across different modalities of perceptual, cognitive and action control processes. Since such cross-talks are manifested in many different processing channels and pathways that emerge in parallel, the findings of my research immediately provide clear insights into complex brain-behavior relationships across time and context, leading to translational studies to improve the way we interact with, respond to, and control the external world.<br/>

## **1. Perceptual flexibility empowers cognitive capabilities and action outcomes.**
The visual system reorganizes complex visual scenes using efficient strategies to form coherent and concise representations, rather than passively receiving all (millions of) bits of visual information hitting our retinas at any given moment. One powerful heuristic is to represent sets of similar objects as a group or **ensemble** using summary statistics such as mean, numerosity, and variance, etc. Ensemble perception makes great intuitive sense - If we look around, we always find some redundancy and regularity in the real world images and scenes. The trees in a forest, the grass in a field, a flock of
birds, the cars in a parking lot, for example, are seen as groups of similar but not identical objects about which we may not
need to store individuating information for most everyday purposes and needs. By exploiting the natural redundancy and regularity, we can represent the structure and process copious amounts of information in a succinct and elegant manner. My research has shown that such perceptual ability to represent ensemble statistics from complex visual scenes can allow the brain to "do more with less" in order to better understand and interact with the visual environment. Ensemble perception is a crucial mechanism for coping with the limitations on visual processing, enhancing our cognitive abilities (e.g., remembering or making decisions) and action outcomes in many ways.

I have shown that representations of objects and ensembles can be extracted to be available at the same time, such that they provide complementary information about the scene to be combined into a unified perception. By combining these different levels of representation, the visual system can perceive, and we can remember, the visual scene with greater detail, which can then effectively guide better action outcomes. For example, a visual impression of how objects are spatially clustered in the whole image modulates the way we see, remember, and act on each individual object in the scene.

Thus, these findings provide an insight to richness of our perceptual experiences, resulting from hierarchical coding of different levels and modalities of visual representations. Characterizing how such hierarchical representations fill in the gaps in our perception will also have broad applicability to science and engineering that is impacted by the interface between sighted humans and machines of all types.<br/>




## **2. Action goals guide perception.**
------
Interactions between perception and action are bidirectional. I have found the behavioral and neural evidence suggesting that different social motivations and action goals (e.g., approach and avoidance) shape the way we perceive emotional states and behavioral intent of crowds of people.

For example, when the observersâ€™ goal was to avoid a potential threat in a social environment, they recognized a crowd of angry faces much more accurately and rapidly than a crowd of happy faces5. This finding suggests that our goals for ongoing interactions with the external world influences the way we perceive the world, just as what we see guides our ongoing interactions with the world. Furthermore, my fMRI and MEG data showed that there are (at least) two different processing routes for this: a fast processing route along the dorsal pathway in the brain for global perception of, and fast reaction to, social crowds and a slower processing route along the ventral pathway for local and detailed perception of individual faces.

## **3. Attentional distraction can facilitate perception and action.** 
------
Although it is generally accepted, and usually valid, that distracted attention impairs perceptual and behavioral performance, I have found advantages of distributed (or distracted) attention over focused attention in some perceptual tasks and motor learning.

For example, distributed attention facilitates global processing of a visual image and enhances memory retrieval of visually-guided actions that have been learned under similar distraction. These results suggest that as another processing route, distributed attention can enhance our perception and action under some circumstances in which focused attention may actually hinder performance. A broader attentional focus afforded by reduced control under distributed attention can allow us to learn more about the background and context of the environment, compared to the mode of focused attention.

This line of research has led me to pursue one of my future research aims of characterizing how these non-selective and selective routes guide each other to support different aspects for our complex behaviors, with the goal of understanding how cognition modulates perception and action in our complex behaviors across a range of tasks.

New findings from this research will contribute to better rehabilitation/training programs for patients with motor degenerative diseases and those who need to refine and adjust their perception-action coordination after injuries or surgeries. _This work in this area was recognized and partially supported by a Center for Vision Research Award at Brown University._<br/>

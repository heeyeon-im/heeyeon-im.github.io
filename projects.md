My research projects aim to identify and understand how brain dynamics guide adaptive behaviors in human. Human behaviors are made up of cross-talks across different modalities of perceptual, cognitive and action control processes. Since such cross-talks are manifested in many different processing channels and pathways that emerge in parallel, the findings of my research immediately provide clear insights into complex brain-behavior relationships across time and context, leading to translational studies to improve the way we interact with, respond to, and control the external world.<br/>

## **1. Perceptual flexibility empowers cognitive capabilities and action outcomes.**
The visual system reorganizes complex visual scenes using efficient strategies for forming coherent and concise representations, rather than passively receiving all (millions of) bits of visual information hitting our retinas at any given moment. One powerful heuristic for this is to represent sets of similar objects as a group or **_ensemble_** using summary statistics such as mean, numerosity, and variance, etc.

Ensemble perception makes great intuitive sense. If we look around, we always find some redundancy and regularity in the real world images and scenes: Blueberries in a bush, trees in a forest, and buildings in a city, for example, are often seen as groups of similar but not identical objects. For most everyday needs, we may not need to store individuating information from these scenes. We can instead represent structures, patterns, and gists in a succinct and compact manner. Such perceptual ability to represent ensemble statistics from complex visual scenes can allow the brain to "do more with less" and better understand and interact with visual environments. One line of my research program investigates this ability by addressing how our brain achieves this feat and how ensemble perception empowers our perceptual, cognitive, and action control abilities in many different ways.

In one of my study (Im, Zhong, & Halberda, 2016, see Demo here), I employed a computer vision algorithm to characterize and predict human observers' patterns of grouping multiple dots into sets based on spatial proximity. I found that human observers' grouping pattern was surprisingly similar, even though we asked them to group the dots in whatever way they felt the most comfortable and natural.
Moreover, I also found that the way human observers grouped the dots into sets (predicted by the model uisng my clustering algorithm) systematically modulated the way they estimated the number of individual dots.

Although Images A and B both have 29 dots, the estimated number of individual dots by human observers were dramatically different, with Image A (less clustered) being perceived as having more dots than Image B (more clustered). My clustering algorithm could accurately predict the degree to which human observers underestimated the number of individual dots in the more clustered image (e.g., Image B). The findings of this study provides an example of how representations of "sets" and "individual objects" are extracted from the same image to interact with each other: _The way dots are grouped and clustered modulates visual impression of number of the individuals, just as the way individuals are positioned modulates the way they are grouped._

## Current research projects
------
* **Visual perception of ensembles and objects linked to different action goals:** This research characterizes how the human brain is wired up to create different units of perception - individual objects and ensembles - as a means of managing efficient and flexible descriptions of the visual world. Our work shows that the human brain can quickly form higher-order descriptions of multiple objects (e.g., average, variance, or numerosity of sets), while it can also perceive a few objects as “individual” entities at the same time. These two different representations can provide complementary information about parts and the whole. Combining or flexibly shifting between them allows for a coherent and comprehensive perception of the (ever-changing) visual world, which is crucial for our everyday actions and behaviours to be adaptive, motivated, and interactive. We study how this is achieved through interactions among different brain areas. Our recent work also explores how different action goals and behavioural motivations influence the way the visual system utilizes representations of objects and ensembles, selectively prioritizing one over the other.<br/>

* **Brain dynamics in perceiving and responding to facial threat cues:**
Face perception naturally triggers goal-directed actions based on social, behavioural motivations to either 'approach for more exploration' or 'avoid danger.' For example, seeing angry mobs or panicked crowds will alert us to potential dangers and motivate immediate avoidance behaviours. Detection of threats from others' faces must occur rapidly, since delays are often very costly and maladaptive. Our work examines the groups of brain regions actively engaged in this action-oriented (and time-sensitive) visual processing and the timing of the neural events in these areas when mediating fast connections between vision and action. We also characterize dynamic, recurrent interactions of widely distributed brain regions underlying the integration of visual perception and goal-directed action.<br/>

* **MEG decoding of children's brains:** This decoding project is to discover brain dynamics in perceiving spoken languages during the early period of life (6 months - 4 years). Based on our preliminary MEG decoding data, we expect to be able to characterize fine-scale time courses of different Japanese speech sounds encoded across the superior temporal plane of the children's brains. We can also determine different brain connectivities emerging in children with vs. without previous exposure to the Japanese language. In addition to contributing to developmental neuroscience, our work may provide valuable information for speech-language pathology and designing a device for replaying spoken speech sounds encoded in the brain to assist children with hearing or specific language impairments. We also hope to develop and extend this approach to test other perceptual abilities, including understanding facial expressions and understanding other's actions.<br/>

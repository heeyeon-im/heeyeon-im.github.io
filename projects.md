## Ensemble coding<br/>


## Brain dynamics in perceiving threats from faces<br/>


## Visually-guided actions<br/>


## MEG decoding of children's brains<br/>

<p>We are currently working on a brain decoding project to discover brain dynamics in perceiving spoken languages during the early period of life (6 months - 4 years). Based on our preliminary MEG decoding data, we expect to be able to characterize fine-scale time courses of different Japanese speech sounds encoded across the superior temporal plane. We can also determine different brain connectivities emerging in children with vs. without previous exposure to the Japanese language. In addition to contributing to developmental neuroscience, our work may provide valuable information for speech-language pathology and designing a device for replaying spoken speech sounds encoded in the brain to assist children with hearing or specific language impairments.</p><br/>

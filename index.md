# About<br/>
I'm a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in Dr. Kestutis Kveraga's [Neurodynamics lab](http://www.kveragalab.org/index.html) at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. I received my Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University ([Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences](https://pbs.jhu.edu/)), working with Dr. [Justin Halberda](http://www.halberdalab.net/). Before coming to Boston, I also worked with Dr. [Joo-Hyun Song](http://research.clps.brown.edu/songlab/) in the [Department of Cognitive, Linguistic & Psychological Sciences](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/home) at Brown University.<br/>

I study how perception, cognition, and action control processes continuosly interact with one another to support adaptive human behaviors. Human behaviors are surprisingly flexible and goal-driven in diverse contexts. Not only that, our visual impression of the external world is richly detailed; and the way we react to each circumstance is effective enough to deal with constant changes across time and context. However, what scientific findings consistently suggest is rather surprising in that we only seem to see or remember only a few (three or four) things at a time. Thus, there is a clear discrepancy that existing models fail to explain, given the complexity of human behaviors: How can we understand and interact with the dynamic and complex environment so well? What are the strategies that allow us to "do more with less"? I seek for complementary and novel answers to these questions by identifying dynamic relationships between brain and behaviors.<br/>

Determining the mechanism by which many thousands or millions of patterns of neural activity are relevant for ever-changing human behavior may appear as an insurmountable challenge. One approach to the solution may be taking the simplest-case scenario and identifying a one-to-one mapping between a brain area and its function for a single behavior. However, I strive to adapt an opposite approach by making the task more complex. By studying how the brain solves the same problem in many different contexts and for different action outcomes, I aim to delineate the invariant components of brain dynamics that are critical to the task at hand and the variable components that are rather supplementary. Adaptive and flexible human behaviors may emerge from different interactions between these invariant and variant components of brain dynamics.<br/>

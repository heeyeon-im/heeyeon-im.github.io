Human behaviors are surprisingly adaptive and goal-driven in diverse contexts. Not only that, our visual impression of the external world is richly detailed; and the way we respond to each circumstance is effective enough to deal with constant changes across time and context. However, what previous findings consistently suggest is rather surprising in that we only seem to carry limited capacity of perception, attention and memory. There is such a clear discrepancy that existing models fail to explain given the complexity of human behaviors. How do we execute and control our real-time actions in the dynamic and complex environment, despite limited mental resource? My research aims to provide complementary and novel answers to this conundrum, while uncovering the foundations of human behaviors. 

Human behaviors are made up of complex patterns of neural activity and dynamics across multiple brain areas. Determining the mechanism by which many thousands or millions of patterns of neural activity are relevant for ever-changing human behavior can appear as an insurmountable challenge. One approach to the solution may be directly mapping a very simple behavior and a specific brain area one by one. However, I strive to adapt an opposite approach by making the task more complex: By studying how the brain solves the same problem in many different contexts and for different action outcomes, I aim to delineate the invariant components of brain dynamics that are critical to the task at hand and the variable components that are rather supplementary. Adaptive and flexible human behaviors may emerge from different interactions between these invariant and variant components of brain dynamics.
